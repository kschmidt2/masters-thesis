            <p>On January 8, 2014, the Bergen Record reported that members of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s team ordered the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge that crippled the tiny borough of Fort Lee, N.J., for four days the previous September. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p id="p2">Uncovered emails indicated that the lane closures were retaliation for Mayor Mark Sokolich's failure to endorse Christie in his re-election bid. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>The scandal had national implications as the damage to Christie’s reputation crippled his presidency run in 2016. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Last September, the Record announced more than 40% of its newsroom employees would be laid off in a “restructuring” of the paper. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>The layoffs are part of a larger, decade-long trend. Nationwide, newspaper employment fell to 32,900 in 2014, down from a high of more than 56,000 in 2000. From 1994 to 2014, the industry shed 39 percent of its jobs. Meanwhile, reporters are expected to produce more content than ever.</p>

            <p>A free press that actively covers politics has long been considered an essential component of democracy. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1789, "were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.” </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>But newspapers are in trouble. The rise of the internet, coupled with the effects of the Great Recession, has led to massive downsizing of newsrooms across the country. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Daily newspaper circulation was down almost 7 percent in 2015, the biggest decline since 2009. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Despite the decline in numbers, circulation revenue at publicly traded newspaper companies has increased over the past few years due to increases in subscription rates.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>But money from advertising, which makes up the majority of a newspaper’s revenue, was down almost 8 percent, the most since 2009.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>And between 2004 and 2016, one in 10 daily newspapers and one in 12 weekly newspapers closed. </p>

            <p><b>Newspapers lead government coverage</b></p>

            <p>Those who get their news on the internet or on television may not be concerned about the problems facing the newspaper industry. But broadcast news follows the agenda set by newspapers, and a 2010 study found that in big cities, 53 percent of local government news stories appeared in newspapers. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>The differences were even greater for local government coverage in the suburbs. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Meanwhile, the downsizing in newsrooms has led to less coverage of government. In an analysis of Congressional election coverage, one study found 5,851 news stories covering 787 major-party candidates in 2010 versus 4,524 covering 763 candidates in 2014. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Coverage has also decreased at the state level. In 2014, there were 319 newspaper reporters covering state capitols full-time, down from 524 in 2003. In total, there were 741 full-time statehouse reporters across all media outlets. The number of reporters varies widely by state. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p><b>The decline of agenda-setting and the rise of partisanship</b></p>

            <p>The increase in entertainment choice, first through cable television then through the internet, has created a greater knowledge divide between those who follow the news and those who don’t. The so-called “news junkies” tend to be stronger partisans than the general population, leading to a more partisan audience for news. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>This increase in choice has also led to a diminished ability of the press to set a common agenda, which diminishes the ability of the public to come together on common issues and maximizes polarization. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>As of 2015, 53 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents considered themselves mostly or considerably conservative, up from 31 percent in 2004. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>60 percent of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents considered themselves mostly or considerably liberal, up from 49 percent in 2004 and 30 percent in 1994. </p>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Animosity toward the opposing party has also been on the rise.</p>

            <p><b>A universal benefit</b></p>

            <p>Even those who don’t follow the news benefit from the work of journalists. News serves the entire community by informing the public and allowing people to hold the government and other institutions accountable. Newspapers are important “in order for people to feel connected to the government or know they’re being heard,” said Lee Shaker, a professor at Portland State University who has studied the effects of closing newspapers. "Without the newspapers, it’s harder for people to feel connected to that place, which drives a wedge between them and their government.” </p>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Communities in Northern Kentucky learned the effects of diminishing news coverage after the closure of the Cincinnati Post in 2007. The Post, which competed with the Cincinnati Enquirer, provided more than 80 percent of the news coverage in the Kentucky suburbs. </p>

            <p>Particularly in large media markets, those without access to a local paper face additional obstacles to informing themselves about their own local government. </p>

          <section class="step">
            <p>A study of the Los Angeles metro area found that people in communities with a daily newspaper were 71% likely to say they always vote, while those in communities without were 63% likely to say the same. </p>

            <p>On a national scale, one study found that in Congressional districts that are better aligned with media markets, people are better able to recall the name of their House representative, place that representative on an ideological scale, and say things they like and dislike about their representative. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Representatives from these districts are also more disciplined by their constituencies. Their voting conforms less to party line, they are more likely to stand witness before congressional hearings, and they bring more money per capita back to their districts. </p>

            <p><b>A free press and government corruption</b></p>

            <p>“How well any government functions hinges on how good citizens are at making their politicians accountable for their actions,” concluded researchers in a study on government corruption. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>In examining both countries and U.S. states, the researchers found a significantly higher correlation between reduced government corruption and the free circulation of newspapers than between any other factors, including democratic government.</p>

          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Along with non-profit organizations and whistleblowers, newspaper reporters play a major role in exposing government corruption. We know why the lanes leading up to the George Washington Bridge were closed in September 2014 thanks to the work of local reporters. But their jobs, like those of their contemporaries across the country, are continually in jeopardy. </p>

          <section class="step">
            <p>"The next 10 or 15 years in this country are going to be a Halcyon era for state and local political corruption,” said David Simon, creator of The Wire and a former newspaper reporter, in 2009. "It’s going to be one of the great times to be a corrupt politician.” </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Because Simon was talking about corruption that has not been exposed by the media, how is the public supposed to find out if he was right? </p>
