            <p>In driving local political coverage, newspapers serve the entire community. They do so by <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/64252/goodbye-the-age-newspapers-hello-new-era-corruption" target="_blank">informing the public</a> which allows people to hold the government and other institutions accountable. Newspapers are important “in order for people to feel connected to the government or know they’re being heard,” said Lee Shaker, a leading researcher on how the changing media environment alters the relationship that citizens have with their local communities. "Without the newspapers, it’s harder for people to feel connected to that place.” </p>
