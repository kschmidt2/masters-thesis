            <p>On January 8, 2014, <a href="http://archive.northjersey.com/news/christie-says-he-was-misled-on-gwb-lane-closures-1.705813" target="_blank">the Bergen Record reported</a> that members of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s team ordered the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge that crippled the tiny borough of Fort Lee, N.J., for four days the previous September. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p id="p2">Uncovered emails indicated that the lane closures were retaliation for Mayor Mark Sokolich's failure to endorse Christie in his re-election bid. </p>

          <section class="step">
            <p>The scandal had national implications as the damage to Christie’s reputation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/us/politics/chris-christie.html" target="_blank">crippled his presidency run</a> in 2016.</p>

            <p>Last September, the Record <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/01/23/northjersey-announces-staffing-changes/96947370/" target="_blank">announced</a> more than 40% of its newsroom employees would be laid off in a “restructuring” of the paper. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>The layoffs are part of a larger, decade-long trend. Nationwide, <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/" target="blank">newspaper employment fell</a> to 32,900 in 2014, down from a high of more than 56,000 in 2000. From 1994 to 2014, the industry shed 39 percent of its jobs. Meanwhile, reporters are expected to produce more content than ever.</p>

            <p>A free press that actively covers politics has long been considered an essential component of democracy. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1789, "were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.” </p>

            <p>But newspapers are in trouble. The rise of the internet, coupled with the effects of the Great Recession, has led to massive downsizing of newsrooms across the country. </p>

            <p>But <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/" target="blank">money from advertising</a>, which makes up the majority of a newspaper’s revenue, was down almost 8 percent, the most since 2009.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">

            <p><b>Newspapers lead government coverage</b></p>

            <p>Those who get their news on the internet or on television may not be concerned about the problems facing the newspaper industry. But broadcast news follows the agenda set by newspapers, and <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2010/07/29/media-coverage-city-governments/" target="_blank">a 2010 study</a> found that in big cities, 53 percent of local government news stories appeared in newspapers. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>The differences were even greater for local government coverage in the suburbs. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Meanwhile, the downsizing in newsrooms has led to less coverage of government. In an analysis of Congressional election coverage, <a href="http://www.dannyhayes.org/uploads/6/9/8/5/69858539/hayes_lawless_apsa2016.pdf" target="_blank">one study</a> found 5,851 news stories covering 787 major-party candidates in 2010 versus 4,524 covering 763 candidates in 2014. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Coverage has also <a href="http://www.journalism.org/chart/statehouse-reporters-in-the-united-states-2014/" target="_blank">decreased at the state level</a>. In 2014, there were 319 newspaper reporters covering state capitols full-time, down from 524 in 2003. In total, there were 741 full-time statehouse reporters across all media outlets. The number of reporters varies widely by state. </p>

            <p><b>The decline of agenda-setting and the rise of partisanship</b></p>

            <p>The increase in entertainment choice, first through cable television then through the internet, has created a greater knowledge divide between those who follow the news and those who don’t. The so-called “news junkies” tend to be stronger partisans than the general population, leading to a more partisan audience for news. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step blank-step">
            <p>This increase in choice has also led to a diminished ability of the press to <a href="http://www.cjr.org/analysis/media_polarization_journalism.php" target="_blank">set a common agenda</a>, which diminishes the ability of the public to come together on common issues and maximizes polarization. </p>

            <p><b>A universal benefit</b></p>

            <p>Even those who don’t follow the news benefit from the work of journalists. News serves the entire community by <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/64252/goodbye-the-age-newspapers-hello-new-era-corruption" target="_blank">informing the public</a> and allowing people to hold the government and other institutions accountable. Newspapers are important “in order for people to feel connected to the government or know they’re being heard,” said Lee Shaker, a professor at Portland State University who has studied the effects of closing newspapers. "Without the newspapers, it’s harder for people to feel connected to that place, which drives a wedge between them and their government.” </p>

          <section class="step blank-step">
            <p>Communities in Northern Kentucky learned the effects of diminishing news coverage after the closure of the Cincinnati Post in 2007. The Post, which competed with the Cincinnati Enquirer, provided more than 80 percent of the news coverage in the Kentucky suburbs. </p>
            <p>After the paper closed, <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf" target="_blank">one study</a> found fewer people voted in elections for city council, city commission, and school board and fewer candidates sought those seats, while those who did run spent less money on their campaigns, and for councils and commissions, the likelihood of the incumbent winning increased.</p>

          <section class="step blank-step">
            <p>Particularly in large media markets, those without access to a local paper face additional obstacles to informing themselves about their own local government. </p>

            <p><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1078087409351947" target="_blank">A study</a> of the Los Angeles metro area found that people in communities with a daily newspaper were 71% likely to say they always vote, while those in communities without were 63% likely to say the same. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step blank-step">
            <p>On a national scale, <a href="http://economics.mit.edu/files/2984" target="_blank">one study</a> found that in Congressional districts that are better aligned with media markets, people are better able to recall the name of their House representative, place that representative on an ideological scale, and say things they like and dislike about their representative. </p>
            <p>Representatives from these districts are also more disciplined by their constituencies. Their voting conforms less to party line, they are more likely to stand witness before congressional hearings, and they bring more money per capita back to their districts. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step blank-step">
            <p>The researchers estimate that by increasing the match between media markets and Congressional districts from its lowest value to its highest, the number of articles written about the representatives increases <strong>50 percent</strong>.</p>
            <p>In turn, this increases voters’ ability to correctly name the candidates in the House race by <strong>30 percent</strong> and their willingness to describe and rate the representative by <strong>20-30 percent</strong>. It also increases the representatives’ witness appearances by <strong>46 percent</strong>, and reduces the gap between Republican and Democratic ideological differences in voting by <strong>25 percent</strong>. Finally, it increases federal spending per capita by <strong>10 percent</strong>.</p>

            <p><b>A free press and government corruption</b></p>

            <p>“How well any government functions hinges on how good citizens are at making their politicians accountable for their actions,” <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~cboix/JLEO-paper.pdf" target="_blank">concluded researchers</a> in a study on government corruption. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>In examining both countries and U.S. states, the researchers found a significantly higher correlation between reduced government corruption and the free circulation of newspapers than between any other factors, including democratic government.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="step blank-step">
            <p>Along with non-profit organizations and whistleblowers, newspaper reporters play a major role in exposing government corruption. We know why the lanes leading up to the George Washington Bridge were closed in September 2014 thanks to the work of local reporters. But their jobs, like those of their contemporaries across the country, are continually in jeopardy. </p>

            <p>"The next 10 or 15 years in this country are going to be a Halcyon era for state and local political corruption,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq2_wSsDwkQ" target="_blank">said David Simon</a>, creator of The Wire and a former newspaper reporter, in 2009.
